There are three main objectives. First, it explores the cultural and psychological factors that make Icelandic landscapes so therapeutic for the Chinese. Second, it aims to prove how photographs of natural landscapes (two-dimensional images) can have a healing effect on individuals.Third, it strives to create a model for sorting healing photographs and making them useful for selecting images for healing albums. A Likert-scale questionnaire was distributed to 1,000 participants from China, 500 individuals who have visited Iceland, and 500 who have not. This diverse pool consists of 500 males and 500 females, spanning ages from 10 to 80. The results revealthe top-ranked landscapes and significantimprovements in participants’ psychological well-being after viewing the pictures. The findings support the therapeutic nature of the curated collection of forty photographs, providing inspiration and promoting well-being through the beauty and transformative power of nature. This experimental investigation contributes to an understanding of healing landscapes and their potential in assisting psychological therapy and landscape design. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chinese Travelers
